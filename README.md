# Crawler

Easily fetch the HTML from any website by using Google Chrome instead of a basic GET request.


## Quickstart

Run these commands to quickly try out this service.
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}' http://localhost:5002
```

## Run locally

To clone this project and build from source,
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}' http://localhost:5002
```


## Integrate with your app

You're building an app that needs to crawl websites, but some sites are witholding their HTML from your simple GET requests? And you don't want to install Google Chrome on your app's container? Well, you came to the right place.
